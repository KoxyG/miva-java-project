## Overview

SLCAS (Smart Library Circulation & Automation System) is a library management application that demonstrates:

- **Advanced Object-Oriented Programming** — abstract classes, interfaces, inheritance, polymorphism, encapsulation, and composition
- **Efficient data structures** — ArrayList, Queue, Stack, and a fixed-size array cache
- **Student-implemented algorithms** — linear/binary/recursive search; selection, insertion, merge, and quick sort
- **Recursion** — overdue charge calculation, category counting, and recursive catalogue search
- **Event-driven GUI programming** — Swing panels, listeners, timers, dialogs, and layout managers
- **File persistence** — save and load library data as JSON text files

The application loads with sample data (5 library items and 3 users) so it can be demonstrated immediately after launch.

## Features

| Feature | Description |
|---|---|
| **View Items** | Browse the full catalogue in a colour-coded table (green = available, yellow = borrowed, red = overdue) |
| **Borrow / Return** | Check items out for 14 days, return them, and join a FIFO reservation waitlist |
| **Admin Panel** | Add books, magazines, and journals with dynamic type-specific fields; undo last admin action |
| **Search & Sort** | Search by title, author, or type; sort by title, author, or year using a selectable algorithm |
| **Reports** | Most borrowed items, overdue users, category distribution, and access cache report |
| **Save / Load** | Export and import `items.json` and `users.json` via a file chooser dialog |
| **Overdue Timer** | Background timer checks every 30 seconds and updates the status bar when items are overdue |

| Recursion | Overdue charge, category count, recursive search |
| GUI tabs | View Items, Borrow/Return, Admin, Search & Sort, Reports |
| Advanced GUI | Custom renderer, dynamic fields, file chooser, timer, validation, tooltips, mnemonics |
| Persistence | JSON files via `FileHandler` |
| Reports | Most borrowed, overdue users, category distribution |

## Data Structures & Algorithms

### Data Structures

| Structure | Where Used | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| **ArrayList** | `LibraryDatabase` | Store all library items and user accounts |
| **Queue** | `BorrowController` | FIFO reservation waitlist — first reserved, first served |
| **Stack** | `LibraryDatabase` | LIFO undo stack for admin add/delete operations |
| **Array** | `ItemCache` | Fixed-size cache tracking the 10 most frequently accessed items |

### Search Algorithms

| Algorithm | When Used | Time Complexity |
|---|---|---|
| **Linear search** | Default; unsorted lists; partial matches | O(n) |
| **Binary search** | After sorting by title; exact title lookup | O(log n) |
| **Recursive search** | Selected from GUI; partial title match | O(n) |

### Sort Algorithms

All four are implemented in `SortAlgorithms.java` and selectable from the Search & Sort tab:

| Algorithm | Best For |
|---|---|
| **Selection Sort** | Simple, easy to trace — O(n²) |
| **Insertion Sort** | Nearly sorted data — O(n²) |
| **Merge Sort** | Stable, consistent performance — O(n log n) |
| **Quick Sort** | Fast average case — O(n log n) |

### Recursive Algorithms

1. **Overdue charge** — `$0.50` per day; recurses one day at a time until the due date is reached
2. **Category count** — walks the item list recursively to count books, magazines, and journals
3. **Recursive search** — searches the catalogue by recursing through the list index by index

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Java 17 or higher** (the project uses switch expressions and pattern matching)

### Run the Application

```bash
cd miva-project
./run.sh
```

### Manual Compile & Run

```bash
export JAVA_HOME=/Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/jdk-23.jdk/Contents/Home
mkdir -p out
javac -d out $(find src -name "*.java")
java -cp out gui.MainWindow
```

## Usage Guide

### View Items
Browse the full catalogue. Click **View Details** on a selected row to see type-specific information (ISBN for books, issue number for magazines, etc.).

### Borrow / Return
1. Select a **user** and an **item** from the dropdowns
2. Click **Borrow Item** — the loan period is 14 days
3. If the item is already borrowed, the user is automatically added to the waitlist
4. Click **Return Item** to return; the next waitlisted user receives the item automatically

### Admin
1. Choose **Add Item** or **Add User**
2. Select item type (Book / Magazine / Journal) — extra fields appear dynamically
3. Fill in the form and click **Add Item** or **Add User**
4. Use **Undo Last Action** to reverse the most recent admin operation
5. Select an item in View Items, then click **Delete Selected Item** to remove it

### Search & Sort
1. Enter a search query and choose the search type (Linear, Binary, Recursive, Author, Type)
2. Click **Search**
3. To sort, pick a field (Title / Author / Year) and algorithm, then click **Sort All Items**

### Reports
- **Most Borrowed Items** — ranked by borrow count
- **Overdue Users** — users with items past their due date and calculated charges
- **Category Distribution** — count of books, magazines, and journals
- **Save Data / Load Data** — export or import JSON files to a chosen folder

## Running Tests

The project includes **39 unit tests** with no external dependencies (no JUnit required):

```bash
./run-tests.sh
```

| Test Class | Coverage |
|---|---|
| `SearchEngineTest` | Linear, binary, recursive search; search by type |
| `SortAlgorithmsTest` | Selection, insertion, merge, quick sort correctness |
| `BorrowControllerTest` | Borrow, return, waitlist queue, auto-assign on return |
| `ItemCacheTest` | Fixed-size array cache access tracking |
| `LibraryManagerTest` | Undo stack, recursive charge/count, polymorphic processing |

---

## Design Decisions

**Why Merge Sort as the default recommendation?**
Merge sort guarantees O(n log n) performance regardless of input order and is stable (preserves relative order of equal elements), making it reliable for catalogue sorting before binary search.

**Why a Stack for undo?**
Admin operations are reversed in last-in-first-out order, which matches natural user expectation — undoing the most recent action first.

**Why a Queue for reservations?**
Library waitlists are fair: the first person to reserve an item should receive it first when it is returned (FIFO).

**Why JSON for persistence?**
Human-readable text files are easy to inspect, debug, and submit as part of the project without requiring a database.

**Package separation**
The four-package layout (`model`, `controller`, `gui`, `utils`) keeps domain logic independent of the UI, making the system easier to test and maintain.
